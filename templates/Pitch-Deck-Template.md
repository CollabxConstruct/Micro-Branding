## Presentation Design Principles

### Narrative Structure
Every great deck follows a story arc:

1. **Setup** — Establish the world and the stakes
2. **Tension** — Introduce the problem or conflict
3. **Resolution** — Present your solution
4. **Proof** — Show evidence it works
5. **Call to Action** — What happens next

---

### Slide Design Rules

#### 1. One Idea Per Slide
- If you need two points, use two slides
- Each slide should advance a single thought
- Don't cram—simplify

#### 2. Headlines That Sell
- Every slide title should advance the argument, not just label content
- ❌ "Our Process"
- ✅ "A Process Built for Speed Without Sacrificing Quality"

#### 3. Visual Hierarchy
- Most important element = largest
- Supporting details = smaller
- Use size, color, position to guide the eye

#### 4. Minimal Text
- If you're reading slides aloud, there's too much text
- Use speaker notes for details
- Slides should support your talk, not replace it

#### 5. Consistent Visual System
- Repeating colors, typography, layout patterns create professionalism
- Establish a grid and stick to it
- Use consistent treatment for similar content

#### 6. Data Visualization
- Always chart data; never just list it
- Choose the right chart type:
  - **Line chart**: Trends over time
  - **Bar chart**: Comparisons between items
  - **Pie chart**: Parts of a whole (use sparingly)
  - **Scatter plot**: Correlations
- Label clearly and remove chart junk

---

### Presentation Flow

#### Opening
- ❌ Don't start with "Thanks for having us" or "Agenda"
- ✅ Do start with something unexpected:
  - Provocative question
  - Surprising statistic
  - Bold statement
  - Compelling visual

#### Build Momentum
- Each slide should make the audience want to see the next one
- Create tension before resolution
- Use pacing—some slides are fast, some deserve pause

#### The Big Reveal
- The big idea should feel earned, not premature
- Build to it systematically
- Don't reveal too early or the deck deflates

#### Ending
- End with clarity—the audience should know exactly what you want
- Strong call to action
- Leave time for questions
- Thank them and express enthusiasm

---

### Color Guidelines

- Use color to emphasize, not decorate

**Contrast**:

---

## Slide-by-Slide Guidelines

### Cover Slide
- Project/presentation name

- Presenter name/company
- Striking visual or clean brand expression

### Agenda Slide (Optional)
- Use sparingly—most decks don't need this
- Only include if presentation is long (>20 slides)
- Make it visual, not a bullet list

### Section Dividers
- Use to break up long presentations
- Full-bleed visual + section name
- Creates breathing room

### Data Slides
- Lead with the insight, not the data
- One chart per slide
- Clearly labeled axes and data points
- Annotate what matters

### Quote Slides
- Large, impactful typography
- Attribution (source, date if relevant)
- Minimal decoration
- Use quotes that advance your argument

### Closing Slide
- Thank you message
- Contact information
- Call to action
- Avoid "Questions?" as the final slide—use as transition to Q&A
