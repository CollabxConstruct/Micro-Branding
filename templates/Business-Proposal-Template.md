## Pricing Guidelines

### Pricing Models

#### 1. Project-Based / Fixed Fee
**When to Use**: Defined scope with clear deliverables

**Pros**:
- Client knows total cost upfront
- Encourages efficiency
- Easier to sell

**Cons**:
- Scope creep risk
- Underestimating scope loses money

**How to Price**:
- Estimate hours required × blended rate
- Add 10-20% contingency
- Consider value delivered, not just time

---

#### 2. Retainer
**When to Use**: Ongoing relationships with recurring needs

**Pros**:
- Predictable revenue
- Stronger client relationships
- Encourages strategic partnership

**Cons**:
- Requires hour tracking
- Can become unbalanced

**How to Price**:
- Estimate monthly hours needed
- Discount from standard hourly rate (10-20%)
- Set minimums (e.g., 6-12 months)

---

#### 3. Time & Materials (Hourly/Daily)
**When to Use**: Uncertain scope or exploratory projects

**Pros**:
- Low risk for agency
- Flexibility for changes

**Cons**:
- Unpredictable cost for client
- Perceived as inefficient

**How to Price**:
- Set hourly or daily rates by role
- Provide estimate range
- Cap if possible

---

#### 4. Value-Based Pricing
**When to Use**: ROI is measurable and significant

**Pros**:
- Aligns incentives
- Can command higher fees
- Perceived as partnership

**Cons**:
- Requires ROI clarity
- Risk if results don't materialize

**How to Price**:
- Calculate expected value/ROI for client
- Price as % of value (typically 10-30%)
- Ensure measurable outcomes

---

#### 5. Hybrid Model
**When to Use**: Complex projects with some uncertainty

**Example**: Fixed fee for Phase 1 + T&M for implementation

**Pros**:
- Balances predictability and flexibility

---

### Pricing Presentation Best Practices

**Frame in Context of Value**:
- "This $50K investment typically delivers $200K+ in incremental revenue"
- Show ROI, not just cost

**Offer Options When Appropriate**:
| Option | Scope | Investment | Best For |
|--------|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Good** | Core deliverables | $[Amount] | Budget-conscious, clear scope |
| **Better** | Enhanced scope + extras | $[Amount] | Comprehensive solution |
| **Best** | Full scope + ongoing support | $[Amount] | Strategic partnership |

**Be Transparent**:
- Show what's included
- Explain what triggers additional costs
- Break down large numbers (monthly vs. total)

**Handle Price Objections**:
- "Compared to what?" — Context matters
- "What's the cost of not solving this problem?"
- "Let's revisit scope to meet your budget"
