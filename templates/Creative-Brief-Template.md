## Writing Guidelines

### Brief Writing Principles

**1. Brevity over completeness**
- One page is ideal, two is maximum
- Edit ruthlessly — every sentence must earn its place
- Use bullets and structure for scannability

**2. Provocative insight over safe observation**
- The insight should make the creative team lean forward
- Test: Would this insight be true for any brand in the category? If yes, dig deeper.

**3. Specificity over generality**
- "25-34 year old urban renters who meal-prep on Sundays" beats "health-conscious millennials"
- Vivid details unlock creativity

**4. One ask, not five**
- If everything is important, nothing is
- Prioritize ruthlessly — what's the ONE thing that matters most?

**5. Inspire, don't prescribe**
- Frame the problem sharply; let creatives find the solution
- Give creative boundaries, not creative solutions

---

### Common Brief Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Multiple objectives disguised as one**
- Wrong: "Increase awareness and drive consideration and boost conversions"
- Right: "Drive product consideration among first-time buyers"

❌ **Insight that's just an observation**
- Wrong: "Moms are busy"
- Right: "Moms feel guilty about outsourcing care, even when it makes life easier"

❌ **Vague audience definition**
- Wrong: "Millennials who care about sustainability"
- Right: "28-35 year old urban professionals who thrift-shop on weekends and feel anxious about their carbon footprint but struggle to make eco-friendly choices convenient"

❌ **Mandatories buried in creative direction**
- Separate what MUST happen from what SHOULD happen
- Be explicit about what's negotiable vs. non-negotiable

❌ **No clear success criteria**
- Tie metrics back to the objective
- Make them specific and measurable
