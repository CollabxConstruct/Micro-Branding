## Core Brand Strategy Frameworks

### 1. Brand Positioning Framework

Every strong brand needs a clear positioning that answers:

#### **Brand Purpose**
*Why does the brand exist beyond profit?*

Purpose connects to deeper human needs or cultural shifts. It's the brand's reason for being.

**Examples**:
- Patagonia: "We're in business to save our home planet"
- Dove: "To help women everywhere develop a positive relationship with beauty"
- Airbnb: "To create a world where anyone can belong anywhere"

**Questions to uncover purpose**:
- What problem in the world does this brand help solve?
- What would be missing if this brand disappeared?
- What change does this brand want to create?

---

#### **Brand Vision**
*What future state is the brand working toward?*

Vision is aspirational and forward-looking (5-10 years). It paints a picture of the world if the brand succeeds.

**Examples**:
- Tesla: "To accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy"
- Microsoft: "To empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more"
- Warby Parker: "A world where everyone has access to great eyewear"

---

#### **Brand Mission**
*How does the brand deliver on its purpose daily?*

Mission is concrete and actionable. It describes what the brand does and for whom.

**Format**: [Action verb] + [What] + [For whom] + [Why/How]

**Examples**:
- Spotify: "To unlock the potential of human creativity by giving a million creative artists the opportunity to live off their art"
- Slack: "To make work life simpler, more pleasant, and more productive"

---

#### **Brand Values**
*3-5 non-negotiable principles that guide decisions*

Values are behavioral—they show up in how teams act, not just what brands say.

**Strong values are**:
- **Specific**: Not generic corporate-speak
- **Memorable**: Team can recall and apply them
- **Actionable**: Guide real decisions
- **Differentiating**: Reflect unique culture

**Example: Airbnb's Core Values**:
1. **Champion the Mission** — Unite behind the why
2. **Be a Host** — Care deeply for customers
3. **Embrace the Adventure** — Take smart risks
4. **Be a Cereal Entrepreneur** — Creative problem-solving

---

#### **Brand Positioning Statement**

**Format**:
For **[target audience]** who **[need/opportunity]**, **[brand]** is the **[category]** that **[key benefit]** because **[reason to believe]**.

**Example: Uber**:
For urban professionals who need reliable transportation, Uber is the ride-sharing app that gets you where you need to go quickly and affordably because our network of drivers is always nearby and our pricing is transparent.

**Example: Apple iPhone**:
For creative professionals and tech enthusiasts who want seamless technology experiences, iPhone is the smartphone that combines intuitive design with powerful performance because of our integrated hardware-software ecosystem.

### 2. Brand Personality & Archetypes

Brand personality makes brands feel human. The 12 brand archetypes (based on Jungian psychology) help define consistent personality:

| Archetype | Desire | Fear | Brand Examples |
|-----------|--------|------|----------------|
| **Innocent** | Happiness, safety | Punishment | Dove, Coca-Cola, Aveeno |
| **Everyman** | Belonging, connection | Standing out | IKEA, Target, Levi's |
| **Hero** | Mastery, achievement | Weakness | Nike, FedEx, Duracell |
| **Outlaw** | Revolution, change | Powerlessness | Harley-Davidson, Virgin, Diesel |
| **Explorer** | Freedom, discovery | Conformity | Jeep, The North Face, Patagonia |
| **Creator** | Innovation, expression | Mediocrity | Adobe, Apple, Lego |
| **Ruler** | Control, success | Chaos | Mercedes-Benz, Rolex, Microsoft |
| **Magician** | Transformation | Unintended consequences | Disney, MAC Cosmetics |
| **Lover** | Intimacy, passion | Being alone/unloved | Chanel, Victoria's Secret, Godiva |
| **Caregiver** | Service, protection | Selfishness | Johnson & Johnson, UNICEF, Volvo |
| **Jester** | Joy, living in moment | Boredom | Old Spice, M&M's, Ben & Jerry's |
| **Sage** | Truth, knowledge | Ignorance | Google, BBC, Harvard |

**How to use archetypes**:
1. Identify the 1-2 archetypes that best fit the brand
2. Use archetype traits to guide voice, tone, visual style
3. Ensure consistency across all brand expressions

---

### 3. Brand Voice & Tone Framework

**Voice** = Brand's consistent personality (doesn't change)
**Tone** = Contextual adaptation (changes based on situation)

#### **Defining Brand Voice**

Use a 3-4 characteristic framework:

**Example: Mailchimp**
- **Fun but not childish**
- **Clever but not silly**
- **Confident but not cocky**
- **Informal but not sloppy**

**Example: Slack**
- **Clear**: Easy to understand
- **Conversational**: Like talking to a colleague
- **Playful**: Lighthearted when appropriate
- **Humble**: We don't take ourselves too seriously

#### **Tone Variations**

Create a tone matrix for different contexts:

| Context | Emotional State | Tone | Example |
|---------|----------------|------|---------|
| **Onboarding** | Excited but uncertain | Encouraging, clear | "Welcome! Let's get you set up. This will only take a minute." |
| **Success moment** | Accomplished | Celebratory | "You did it! 🎉 Your first campaign is live." |
| **Error message** | Frustrated | Empathetic, solution-focused | "Oops, something went wrong. Here's how to fix it..." |
| **Upsell** | Neutral | Informative, benefit-focused | "Upgrade to unlock advanced features like..." |
| **Crisis** | Concerned, angry | Transparent, accountable | "We made a mistake. Here's what happened and how we're fixing it." |

### 4. Brand Architecture Models

Choose the right structure for multi-brand portfolios:

#### **Masterbrand / Branded House**
One master brand, all offerings under same name and identity.

**When to use**: Strong brand equity, offerings are related, efficiencies matter
**Examples**:
- Google (Search, Maps, Drive, Photos)
- Virgin (Airlines, Mobile, Money, Trains)
- FedEx (Express, Ground, Freight)

**Pros**: Cost-efficient, halo effect, clear identity
**Cons**: Risk concentrates, harder to target niches

---

#### **Endorsed Brands**
Sub-brands endorsed by parent brand.

**When to use**: Sub-brands need autonomy but benefit from parent credibility
**Examples**:
- Marriott → Courtyard by Marriott, Residence Inn by Marriott
- Nestlé → KitKat by Nestlé, Nespresso by Nestlé

**Pros**: Flexibility + credibility, risk mitigation
**Cons**: More complex to manage, potential confusion

---

#### **House of Brands**
Independent brands, parent invisible to consumers.

**When to use**: Brands serve different audiences, benefit from independence
**Examples**:
- P&G → Tide, Pampers, Gillette, Oral-B
- Unilever → Dove, Axe, Ben & Jerry's, Hellmann's
- VF Corporation → The North Face, Vans, Timberland

**Pros**: Targeted positioning, contained risk, portfolio flexibility
**Cons**: Expensive, no halo effect, complex to manage

---

#### **Hybrid Architecture**
Mix of approaches across portfolio.

**When to use**: Complex portfolios with different strategic needs
**Example: Coca-Cola**:
- Masterbrand: Coca-Cola products (Coke, Coke Zero, Diet Coke)
- House of brands: Sprite, Fanta, Dasani
- Endorsed: Minute Maid by Coca-Cola

### 5. Competitive Positioning Tools

#### **Perceptual Mapping**

Plot brands on two key dimensions to visualize competitive space:

```
         Premium/Luxury
              ↑
              |
   Brand C    |    Brand A
              |
Traditional ← · → Innovative
              |
   Brand B    |    Brand D
              |
              ↓
     Affordable/Value
```

**How to create**:
1. Identify 2 dimensions that matter most to your category (price vs. quality, traditional vs. modern, etc.)
2. Plot where competitors sit
3. Find white space or defensible positions

---

#### **Differentiation Framework**

Evaluate competitive differentiation on three levels:

1. **Category Stakes** (table stakes, everyone needs these)
   - Example in smartphones: Calling, texting, apps

2. **Point of Parity** (competitive necessity)
   - Example: Camera quality, battery life

3. **Point of Difference** (unique competitive advantage)
   - Example: Apple ecosystem integration, Samsung foldable screens

**Strong differentiation is**:
- Meaningful (customers care)
- Deliverable (you can actually do it)
- Defensible (hard to copy)
- Communicable (easy to explain)

❌ **Don't set it and forget it** — Brands need ongoing management
❌ **Don't overcomplicate** — If your team can't explain it, it won't work
