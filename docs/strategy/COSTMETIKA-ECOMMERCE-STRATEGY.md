### Discount Strategy (Use Sparingly)

**Discount Ladder** (Frequency from most to least):

2. **Bundle Discounts**: Increases AOV, moves multiple units
3. **First Purchase**: Converts new customers (10-15% off)
4. **Loyalty Rewards**: Retains existing customers (points system)
5. **Flash Sales**: Occasional urgency (15-25% off, 24-72 hours)
6. **Seasonal Sales**: 2-3x per year (20-40% off select items)

**Avoid**:
- ❌ Constant discounting (devalues brand, trains customers to wait for sales)
- ❌ Site-wide sales (hurts margin, not targeted)
- ❌ Deep discounts on new launches (signals low quality)

**Best Practice**: Discount strategically to achieve specific goals (clear inventory, acquire customers, reward loyalty), not as default strategy.

# Part 3: Customer Lifecycle & Retention

## 3.1 Customer Acquisition

### Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) Targets

**By Channel**:
- **Organic Social** (TikTok, Instagram): $10-20 CPA
  - Low cost (no paid ads), high engagement
  - Calculation: (Content creation time + free product costs) / customers acquired

- **Influencer/Affiliate**: $20-40 CPA
  - Commission + free product costs
  - Calculation: (Commission paid + product cost) / customers acquired

- **Paid Ads** (Later stage): $30-50 CPA
  - Facebook/Instagram, Google, TikTok Ads
  - Calculation: Ad spend / customers acquired

**Target Ratio**: CPA should be ≤ 30% of Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
- If CLV = $200, CPA should be ≤ $60
