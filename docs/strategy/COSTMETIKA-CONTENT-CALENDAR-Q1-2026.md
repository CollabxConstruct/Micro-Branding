"Want glowing skin? These 3 ingredients are non-negotiables."

[4-12s] Ingredient #1
"First: Hyaluronic Acid. It holds 1000x its weight in water—hydration on another level. Your skin will literally drink this up."

[13-21s] Ingredient #2
"Second: Niacinamide. This multitasker reduces redness, minimizes pores, AND evens tone. The overachiever of skincare."

[6-15s] The Rule

[16-35s] Step-by-step demonstration
"Step 1: Cleanser (obviously)
Step 2: Toner or essence—lightweight liquid
Step 3: Serums—your active ingredients
Step 4: Eye cream—delicate skin needs lighter texture
Step 5: Moisturizer—seals everything in

[11-18s] Mistake #2
"❌ You skip hydration. Dehydrated skin looks dull. Layer a hydrating serum under your moisturizer."

[19-26s] Mistake #3

**Caption**:
```
WHY WE STARTED COSTMETIKA 🤍

Three years ago, I was standing in a beauty store, staring at a $75 serum with an ingredient list I couldn't pronounce.

I asked the sales associate what half the ingredients did.
She didn't know.

I asked if it was tested on animals.
She didn't know.

I asked where the ingredients were sourced.
She definitely didn't know.

And I thought: "Why is this normal?"

Why do we accept mystery in an industry built on trust? Why is 'luxury' defined by price tags instead of quality? Why do we have to choose between effective and ethical?

We don't. Not anymore.

COSTMETIKA was born from a simple belief: You deserve to know EXACTLY what you're putting on your skin. Where it comes from. How it's made. Why it works.

Transparent luxury isn't an oxymoron—it's the future.

Every formula: dermatologist-tested, cruelty-free, clean.
Every ingredient: traceable, safe, effective.
Every claim: backed by science, not marketing fluff.

This is beauty you can trust. Because you deserve nothing less.

## Notes on Execution

1. **Flexibility**: This calendar is a framework, not a rigid rulebook. If a trend emerges or current events warrant adjustment, adapt accordingly.

2. **Quality > Quantity**: If you need to reduce posting frequency to maintain quality, do it. Better to post 15 excellent TikToks per week than 22 mediocre ones.

3. **Community First**: Always prioritize genuine engagement over vanity metrics. Respond to every comment in the first hour of posting.

4. **Authenticity**: If a script doesn't feel natural, rewrite it. Your audience can spot inauthenticity instantly.

5. **Momentum**: The first 30 days are about building habits and systems. By Month 2, content creation should feel streamlined.

6. **Data-Driven Adjustments**: Review metrics weekly and adjust. If educational content consistently outperforms, increase its share.

7. **Sustainability**: This is a marathon, not a sprint. Build a content creation process that you can maintain long-term.
