## 7.3 Brand Evolution Principles

**When to Evolve:**
- Market shifts require repositioning
- Audience needs change significantly
- Competitive landscape disrupts differentiation
- Business model expands beyond original scope

**When NOT to Change:**
- Short-term trend pressure
- Single piece of negative feedback
- Internal boredom (team fatigue ≠ customer fatigue)
- Competitor mimicry

**How to Evolve Responsibly:**
- Test changes with small audience segments
- Maintain brand equity (don't throw away recognition)
- Communicate changes transparently to community
- Evolve gradually, not drastically
