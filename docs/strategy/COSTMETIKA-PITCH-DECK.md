# SLIDE 25: RISKS & MITIGATION

## We've Thought Through the Challenges

**Mitigation:**
- 4-tier system (not dependent on any single creator)
- Affiliate model (only pay for results)
- In-house content creation (not outsourced)

### Risk 3: Inventory Management
**Mitigation:**
- Start lean (20-30 SKUs)
- Demand-based expansion
- Dropship or consignment where possible initially

### Risk 4: Customer Acquisition Cost Inflation
**Mitigation:**
- Organic-first strategy (content > ads)
- Community flywheel (UGC, word-of-mouth)
- Repeat purchase focus (retention > acquisition)

### Risk 5: Competitive Response
**Mitigation:**
- First-mover advantage in social commerce beauty

## SPEAKER NOTES

### General Presentation Tips:
1. **Start with energy** — Walk in confident, this is YOUR vision
2. **Tell a story** — Don't just read slides, narrate the journey
3. **Use pauses** — Let big numbers and visuals sink in
4. **Make eye contact** — Connect with each person in the room
5. **End with urgency** — This opportunity won't wait

### Key Moments to Emphasize:
- **Slide 3 (Enter COSTMETIKA):** This is the "aha" moment—make them see the gap you're filling
- **Slide 11 (Revenue Projections):** Confidence in numbers—you've done the math
- **Slide 24 (Why We Win):** This is your competitive moat—own it
- **Slide 28 (Closing):** Leave them inspired and ready to say yes

### Handling Objections:
**"Social commerce is a fad"** → Show $1.2T market data, Gen Z behavior shift
**"Too competitive"** → Emphasize differentiation (social-native, education-first, inclusivity)
**"Platform risk (TikTok ban)"** → Multi-platform strategy, owned channels (email, Shopify)
**"Can you execute?"** → Team expertise, detailed roadmap, proven frameworks

**You've got this. Go get that funding.** 💪✨
